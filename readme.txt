-database name is company name 
-collectionName is fmsCollection
-add these thwo values in .env file
-add router 
-create repo and push the code // merge the code to main backend
-create login pool initialisation based on user -- connect to that specific company db
-eachdb is one company 
-each db has multiple collections for that company , fms master and detail fms
-whenever an fms is initialised for the first time , approval has to be done -- add names on who to approve this(optioanl feature)
-who has access to this fms -change it to fmsFormAccess  - store ID's
-fmsQuestionare change it to fmsInitialForm
-in questionare  - ignore startEndDateTime
-fmsQuestionaeAccess - store both ID and name in an object and make it array of objects 
-add a key for each fms  - at what point is this fms live (live or not live -- status -- give it a boolean - true after all steps are completed and saved(in view fms))


steps
what has to be done - description
who - if all shift - can be assigned to only 1 person
    - if it is Individual Shift 
    - save the shift id and employee id ( for individual shift)
when will you do this step - STRING
How will you do this step
    1) none  - STRING -- add a training link ( how to do a task , maybe an Youtube link)
    2)Checklist - check with salman for frequescy part of Checklist
                -RENAME IT TO CHECKLIST steps FROM MINI STEPS
                -SUBSETS Check with salman
    -Form is there even for checklist and reference format
    -in reerence format there will only be instructions to do that step - array of strings
    -in every step - in how  - the form is non mandatory
    -whatever we do in how , that will be the payload for the task
-lastkey for every step is "type" - "doer" or "quality"
-by default the type is "doer"
-create a step id
-create a fms id as well******************************************
-steps - start time - by default previous steps actual date time (for now ignore the start time)
-T-X --> duration is some , start time is not previous step time , dropdown i need send all the date time formats as options -- T is date time and x is number*hr or d



--location was is not required
--how - (checklist , reference, none) - either of these 3 


--fms initialisdation name - give an option to change it 

ngrok token  -2fHbiUaddJBLgvfxUdXfxCoVbXQ_4KJMC3ATzhSn5EwAq2Xt6


from token get yser id and company
for ansewr q - use same payload 
after submitting calculate planned time and create that task
get a few fms from ahana
after form submission - calculate planned date and time and add task and send notification 
api to get fms tasks
in the tasks - send only overdue and todays tasks in the api
add a status for every step
create db and collection in mongodb once a company is registered

--all fms
--all request formats
--submit qa

create task for a user
fmsMasterId, fmsQAID, taskID , userID(who ??), processid, status(delayed, on time), createdtime(formSubmissionTime), plannedEndTime(time in hrs, time in days), 


-remove duplicates when initializing fms - basically remove the upsert and test it out



/////////////////////////////////////
-change mongo GMT time to IST in create task api ( update task api , submitfmsQA)
-CHECK ALL TASKS( THAT ARE PENDING) , FETCH THE PLANNED START TIME , PLANNED COMPLETION TIME , CHANGE STATUS TO oVERDUE  -- THIS IS IN CRON
-list of tasks for a user is failing
-in fms master - step id there which is being generated from front end , while updating the steps , this mighrt change , so update that as well
-ADD DAYS LOGIC AS WELL IN BOTH THE TASK TRIGGERING FOR STEP 1 AND TASK UPDATION
-add an api to fetch dueToday tasks and all overdue tasks for that employee get request
-once the fmsQA is submitted in the fms Master add one more firld called live fms's and increment that valur - later once all steps for that qa is completed decrement this value 
-for manage fms - admin and pc 
-for a pc which all fms they are port of and all the overdue tasks for all these fms 
-all over overdue tasks irrespective of process or fms
-just all the fms overdue tasks and then fms that a user_id who is the PC is associated with 
-in update fms task api while submitting , when fetching the next taask , if there is no next task mark that fmsqaId AS COMPLETED(add the fmsqa key there)
-make an api where if I pass you fmsmasterid & stepid, can you give me list of previous stepids and what has to be done in an array
-if stepType is "QUALITY" then in update task api, am also sending
    qualityStatus - Yes or No
    qualityScore - number
    if qualityStatus is No then , also passing
    3.1. qualityRedoSteps - array of stepId (stepId which is the lowest needs to be retriggered)
    3.2. scrapStatus - true or false (if true, then that fmsQAId needs to stop right there in that step, should not trigger any new task from any other steps)
-for a master id , tou want ana array of objects , with hall qa id and all tasks for qa id
--/findAllFmsOverdueTasksForPc
--for every task add one more field if it is on time or delayed after apdating that task , if it is delayed add one omre field to calculate the delay
--in every single fms, we need to calculate 4 data points
    Total number of tasks those are pending
    Total number of tasks those are overdue
    Percentage of Overdue tasks - [ number of overdue tasks/ (number of overdue + number of pending) ]
    Percentage of delayed tasks - [ number of delayed tasks / number of completed tasks ]
-deploy latest frontend , give KT to developers and Testers 
-change task plannedCompletionTime , taskCreationTime to IST in fmsTasks
-fix backend deployment in AWS including reading .env for both Microservices
-in fms collection change fmsMasterID to fmsMasterId -- to keep it 100% Uniform
-add proper request payloads to all API's in Postman Collection
-THIS IS HUGE -- ADD QALITY RELATED API AND VALIDATION AND LOGIC
-if task goes beyong planned date/time, status is not changing to OVERDUE. 

--previos task info api send the task id aswell in response , 
--if it is no {}
--if scrape is true -- do not create any more task 
--taskcreationTimeis changed to IST , plannedCompletionTime change that as well to IST -- ADD LOGICS FOR DAYS , VALIDATION FOR HOLIDAYS
--add step Id for previousStepDetails
